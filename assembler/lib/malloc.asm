# Primitive memory allocator: malloc() and free().  Uses a first-fit approach.
#
# Terminology:
#  * range: the area of RAM set aside for the memory allocator
#  * segment: 128 bytes, the smallest unit of range
#  * block: 16 bytes, the smallest unit of allocation (1/8 of a segment)
#  * ledger: bytes at the beginning of the range indicating free/allocated status
#
# Begin by initializing the range that will be used by the allocator by calling malloc_init.
# Initialization happens in 128-byte segments.  Up to 256 segments (32KiB) may be allocated
# into the memory manager (though in practice the range will likely be somewhere around
# 20KiB).
#
# The beginning of the range is used for the ledger. Each bit in the ledger represents
# a 16-byte block. So each 128-byte allocated segment is represented by one byte (16 x 8 = 128)
# The ledger begins at the beginning of the range, so the blocks used by the ledger are marked
# as "used" during initialization.
#
# So we initialize by noting:
#   * address of the beginning of the range (ex. 0x6000)
#   * number of 128-byte segments to allocate (ex. 0x40 (64) -> 8KiB allocation / 512 blocks)
#
# With this, we know how many bytes we need for the ledger (it's the same as the number of
# 128-byte segments we allocated, in this case 0x40 (64).  The actual memory allocations start
# immediately after the ledger.
#
# In our example, the ledger is initialized like so:
#
# |0x6000  |0x6001  |0x6002  |0x6003  |0x6004  |...|0x603f  |0x6040  |
# |11110000|00000000|00000000|00000000|00000000|...|00000000|????????|
#  |--|-allocation-for-ledger-4-bits                       | \
#  `------ledger-64-bytes----------------------------------'  `-first allocatable byte
#
# So in our example, we have a base address of 0x6000, 64 bytes (0x40) of ledger, and
# the allocatable memory runs from 0x6040 -> 0x7fff (8127 bytes).
#
# Bits in the ledger indicate whether the 16-byte block is allocated (1) or free (0).
#
# The address represented by any given bit in the ledger is computed by:
#
#  addr_of_ledger + (full_bytes<<7) + (zero_idx_bit_pos<<4)
#
# This works out like so:
#
# |block|ledger|bit_pos|   block   |note
# |index|index |       |           |
# | 0000|  0   |  0    |0x6000-600f|beginning of range, first block of ledger
# | 0001|  0   |  1    |0x6010-601f|ledger

# Allocating memory uses the first-fit algorithm because it's easy to implement. A new
# malloc request simply walks through the ledger looking for the first 0 (unallocated)
# bit.  It then starts counting until it locates enough contiguous 0's to fit the
# request.  The address of the beginning of the sequence is returned and the ledger
# sets the bits for the allocation to indicate they are now in use.
#
# A faster first-fit can be done with allocations of multiples of 8 blocks (64 bytes)
# as the allocator only has to look for full bytes of 0's in the ledger, not probe
# the number of individual bits that are set.
#
# Freeing memory requires both the address being freed, and the number of 16-byte
# blocks to free.  All the function does is reset the bits representing the address
# and its length.
