# ODY executable loader functions
#
# Given a FAT16 file cluster number, file size, and a filesystem handle
# address, will load the file into memory and executes it, then frees the
# memory.
#
# The detailed internal procedure goes like this:
#  1. 512 byte temporary malloc
#  2. The first sector (up to 512 bytes) of the file is loaded into the temp space
#  3. The file is checked for the 'ODY' header
#  4. The flags byte is read (fourth byte of file - see assembler for details on ODY header)
#  5. Memory is allocated based on the value of the flags byte and the file size
#  6. The temporary malloc is freed
#  7. The file is loaded into memory at $base
#  8. Compute $first_prog_byte = $base + 6 + ($num_rewrites << 1)
#  9. For each rewrite $offset in the ODY header:
#       a. read $val at $base + $offset
#       b. write $val + $first_prog_byte back to $base + $offset
# 10. CALL $first_prog_byte
# 11. free memory at $base
#
# The rewriting is what makes the ODY executable relocatable to different
# memory locations. When assembled, each internal jump or memory lookup is
# referenced against a base address of zero (in ROM). When the program is
# copied into RAM, these addresses now represent an _offset_ from the beginning
# of the program, rather than an absolute address.  So for each of these, we
# take the current value (which we now treat as an offset) and add it to the
# address of the first program byte, resulting in an absolute address that will
# function properly for the program being executed.


# Typical usage:
#  1. Allocate a 512-byte memory region
#  2. Push the filesystem handle addr
#  3. Push the address where to load the binary
#  4. Push the number of sectors to load (1 for first sector)
#  5. Push the directory handle address
#  6. Call :fat16_readfile to load the first sector into memory
#  7. Pop the status byte; check for nonzero status = ATA error

#  8. Push the address of the first loaded sector
#  9. Call :fat16_inspect_ody, which will verify that this is an ODY exe and return the flag byte
# 10. Pop the flag byte
#      * if 0xff, not an ODY executable
#      * else, byte is the ODY flag byte

# 11. Free the temporary 512 bytes of memory
# 12. Based on the flag byte, allocate memory to run the binary

# 13. Push the filesystem handle addr
# 14. Push the address where to load the binary
# 15. Push the number of sectors to load (0 for all)
# 16. Push the directory handle address
# 17. Call :fat16_readfile to load the entire file into memory
# 18. Pop the status byte; check for nonzero status = ATA error

# 18. Push the address where the binary is loaded
# 19. Call :fat16_localize_ody to perform the address rewrites
# 20. Pop the address of the first byte of the program
# 21. Use CALL_D to execute the binary
# 22. :free the binary's memory (or not...)
#
# ODY executables must terminate with a RET (or HLT).

# :fat16_inspect_ody - inspects the first four bytes of a memory
# location presumed to contain an ODY executable.  Verifies that
# the first three bytes are 'O' 'D' 'Y' and if so, returns the
# fourth byte, which is the flag byte.  If it does not appear
# to be an ODY executable, will return 0xff.
#
# Usage:
#  * Push address word to heap
#  * Call function
#  * Pop result byte
