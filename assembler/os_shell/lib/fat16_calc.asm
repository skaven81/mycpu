# Convert a FAT16 cluster number to its LBA address. If a cluster number
# of zero is given, will return the LBA address of the root directory.
# To use:
#  1. Push the address word of a FAT16 filesystem handle
#  2. Push the cluster number word to be converted
#  3. Call the function
#  4. Pop the low word of LBA address
#  5. Pop the high word of the LBA address
